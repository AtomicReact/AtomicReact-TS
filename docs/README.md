AtomicReact is a framework to build Web Apps with atomicity concept
## Requirements
1. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org)

## Getting a little theoretical
AtomicReact was designed using atoms as concept. What are the things in the universe made of?
Let's use an essencial thing in our lives as an example: The Water. The water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Basically Atom Concept is create things from the smallest particle of them.
